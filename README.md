# Graph Neural Network for Resilience in Complex Networks
Data driven study of resiliency for interdependent urban utility networks.
Following are the working plans for this novel study on the urban resiliency.

1. Study different metrics for quantifying the resiliency of the interdependent urban utility networks.
2. testing new branch
